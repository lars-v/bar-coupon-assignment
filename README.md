# Who Accepts Coupons vs. Who Doesn't

## The Pattern

Customers who accepted coupons were already regular visitors to that type of business. Customers who rejected coupons had little or no history with that business type. This pattern held across bars, coffee shops, and restaurants.

## Bar Coupons: The Clearest Divide

**Acceptors**: Visited bars 3+ times per month, were traveling without children, and were under 30 or established regular patrons. Three out of four accepted the coupon.

**Rejecters**: Rarely or never visited bars, were driving with kids, or had no social drinking habits. Only one in three accepted.

The difference: Regular bar-goers were twice as likely to accept as occasional visitors.

## Coffee and Restaurant Coupons: Same Story

**Coffee acceptors** already visited coffee shops at least monthly and received coupons in the morning. **Coffee rejecters** rarely went to coffee shops and got coupons at odd times.

**Restaurant acceptors** were frequent diners with flexible schedules. **Restaurant rejecters** had no dining-out habits and were rushing to work or home.

## What Separated Acceptors from Rejecters

Acceptors had three things rejecters didn't:

1. **Existing relationship** with that business type
2. **Right timing** (morning for coffee, evening for bars, mealtimes for restaurants)
3. **Flexibility** (no urgent destination, no kids in car for bars, adequate time to redeem)

## The Bottom Line

You can't convince non-customers to become customers with a coupon. But you can get existing customers to visit more often. The data shows acceptance rates double when you target people who already use your business type instead of trying to convert new users.
